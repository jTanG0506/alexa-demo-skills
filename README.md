## :question: About
This is a collection of skills I created whilst learning Alexa Skills development. The skills in this repository will mainly be written in Node.js and may contain some skills written in other languages at a later date.

## :page_facing_up: Instructions
In each of the skills in the Skills folder, there are two main components; the ``src`` folder and ``schema.json``
* ``src`` contains the source code for the [AWS Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for this skill
* ``schema.json`` is the [Interaction Model Schema](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/interaction-model-schema.html) for this skill
